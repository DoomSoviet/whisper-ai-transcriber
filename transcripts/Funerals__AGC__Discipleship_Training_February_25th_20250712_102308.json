  "text": " So the clergy training, today we're talking about a very sober topic, few roles. But I think for those of you who've been tracking and looking at everything we've been doing so far, we're bringing meaning to what is the ritual. So it's not going to be a dead work anymore. And we're understanding the mystical nature of the practices. It's going to be a very meaningful, it's breathing life into something that is very necessary in the order of the church and in church structure. Having said that, I don't think we're all gathered here to just learn and gather information. Because I think we as humans can be sometimes hungry for knowledge and revelation. And there's a lot of that, even on a topic as sober, as funerals. There will be lots of revelation pouring out and lots of understanding of our purpose, identity, our position, our eternal purpose, our spirituality, the whole dynamics of the role of the church that transcends beyond this realm of life. So there's a lot of that. So there's a lot of meaning that will be coming into it. So even if you're someone who's never planning on doing any of these things as a leader of a church, I think it's really important to note. But we're not here just to gather information. We're here because we are setting up church. Everyone listening online, you already have your churches or you're just jumping into ministry. I'm sure you will all have your own unique DNA. But why are we doing what we're doing? And at the end of the day, the most important thing on the top of it is to mind and to manage and to feed and to nurture the people of God. And I think that should be our topmost priority. That is why we're setting up the church. That's why we're reinforcing the church. That's why the church matters. That's why Jesus Christ came to feed the sheep, to nurture the sheep, to protect the sheep, to be there for the sheep, to gather them in, to continue bringing them in. And I think this has to be the continuous theme behind everything we're learning without getting sucked in and isolated in one, deep, interesting revelatory field. So I think that's going to be really important. And in line with that, even we at wildlife church are setting up new, because we're growing context is changing, it's progressing. So even we are setting up new divisions and structures, because we're realizing maybe we are doing certain things from an old understanding. God has brought us so far from where we were back then. And we were just discussing just now about how do we welcome new people into the church. Every Sunday, there are heaps of new faces. What are we doing with these people? They're coming in, we're praying, saying, God, increase the flock, grow your church. Are we being faithful with this? Are we nurturing it? Are we growing it? And then there's always the old understanding. And we don't want to be like that old church. Everybody stand up, everybody greets you, everybody jumps on you. We don't want that because we're wow. And then we're actually relooking at that now and saying, no, hang on a minute. We do once a month, meet and greet. Sometimes once in two months. And are we missing out? Are we not being accountable with what God is doing? We're praying, saying, do it for us. He's doing it for us and we're missing the bone. Okay, so all this is, we're setting up new divisions. We're setting up Priskand Kivina, handling community care. We have the youth groups expanding. We have Ronali and Shabon now overlooking the trade, clergy training. So we're morphing and growing as we grow. All this white, not so that we can just have mega church. We're doing it so that we can nurture the flock and keep to the core of why we're doing church. I just want to remind you of that culturally so that your hearts are set up before you go into these deep teachings and you get lost in them. And you're like, oh, you know, we can get lost here. This is the centering anchoring of why we're doing any of this. There's nothing else. I don't know much about this topic to be honest with you. I have been learning myself last week when we were learning about confirmation. And if you're like, oh, my God, this is so new. I mean, I'm speaking from a person who's been a leader in a church, co-founding a church, been doing this for almost, I don't know, 17, 20, 20, 20 years. And I'm speaking to even pastors out there. I've got a master in theology. And I have a master's in theology. La la la la la la la la. And I never learned any of this stuff. So it is new for me. So I'm taking the student position and joining the rest of you that here today. So this is rich stuff. So don't miss out. If you missed out, I don't want to ask you, you missed out. Did you watch? Did you catch up? But I hope you're watching everything that we've done so far. I use myself set and caught up with last week's stuff. So don't miss out. Because there's going to be more and more coming in and it's going to be hard for you to keep up. All right. Thank you. And welcome, Kirby. Thank you, Fierna. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Fierna. Okay. Yes. The only reason we do this stuff is because of people. So we do church because we are feeding the sheep. Okay. I'm not interested in supernatural revelation. I'm not honest. These are the truths of matters. If you want to thank Kirby Land Rover's heart, I'm not interested in revelation much. I'm not so interested in experience much. I don't go behind any of those things. I don't go behind experience angels. Feeling feeling boozy, feeling nice, feeling nice doing a service. How do I feel good in the service? I don't go behind any of that. I don't go behind revelation at all. But we have more of all those things than the average preacher. Okay. But if you ask me why we have it is because I believe we have focused a lot. Manju, welcome. All the way from the USA just yesterday. Yeah. Thank you. I think we have all those experiences because I think our heart is in the right place. And I'm wanting you guys to understand that's where our heart should be. If you're watching me from the USA and you're looking for all these feelings and revelations and all these kind of stuff, just get your heart on God's people. Get your heart on feeding the sheep. And that's everything else flows and I realize that it all flows from there. I'm actually surprised that Funa did four years at Fuller. I'm sorry, I'm sure it's a fabulous university. I'm sure she's got one of the best masters we can get anywhere. But they didn't teach her any of this stuff. And I'm surprised. I know you have to select. But Matthew is just to ask you, you did your PhD. Do they teach the meanings of what they don't write? Okay. But I don't understand, especially in PhDs and specialised. But I don't understand it because it's so important that they teach the practical theology to you guys who are especially wanting to be clergy. Someone will study deeply because they are trying to become clergy. And so, therefore Paul is very wise in saying that sometimes somethings can become a dead work. So when he says, look how many times in Hebrews he uses it, it's a dead work. He said if your conscience is there, it's not there, it's a dead work. And if the dead work, then it leads to death. And therefore the church is now full of traditions and rituals, but not really understanding why it's there. And there is no grace or no power in it because they have not understood it. And so what you're getting is really, really precious. And it comes from, again, I'm going to remind you of what we discussed before. It comes from just one position of lookin'. It's a very simple position. I realise when I started following Robert Cobis van Rensberg, I realised very fast that his point of view always on certain things was his point of view. His POV was from a different place. So because his POV was in a different place, the way he saw things were very different. As you know, looking at something from a different angle, everything changes. So if you look at the sacraments from the point of view as serving people, everything changes, you see? And so I think that's where we in Sri Lanka, these things have to be utility. We don't want to keep something that is like dead. We're constantly asking why are we doing this? Why am I doing it? Why am I singing in this song? Is it okay for me to say the prayer in this way? You see? And I think that's a reformed mind. And Naomi, you can come forward here in city. So the reform mind is always looking at why are we having icons? And is the icon necessary? So it's called iconoclasm. So iconoclasm is a really interesting aspect that a reformer has. It looks at every ritual. Iconoclasmic means you look at every ritual and you look at why do I need this? And I think iconoclasm can get very, it is good, but it can also get very destructive. And so you have iconoclasmic reformers going beyond the methodist with some of the best of it. Then you get the pentacostles and then you have people even like the Baptist who are completely iconoclasmic. That means they destroy everything that looks anything like a ritual. And so even the titles are gone. So it's good, but you have to watch it. And that's what happened in the Grace Movement. Recently, last 10, 20 years, the Grace Movement became extremely iconoclasmic. Destroyed everything that had any substance. But what we are not understanding is because the point of view is different. The point of view is coming from the Holy Spirit is a revelation. That's the problem is. But in the ancient understandings, especially in the Eastern Orthodox, the differ from the Catholic, the Holy Spirit is an energy. As you think that everything changes. So the Spirit has to flow. If it's an energy, you know, electricity needs a wire. And if there is no wire, there is electricity right here, but you can't harness it. There is vapor here, but you can't harness it. Because you don't understand that it's an energy that needs to be alchemized synthesized or the right word. Filtered down. And so because of this one point of view, you can see the destruction that is causing. We are understanding every that the flesh, when you say we are flesh, it's mind that's thoughts and body as well. So it's a container. Thoughts and body are the same thing and they contain spirit. So when you come from that angle, you're always realizing, oh my God, the Holy Spirit needs to flow. Oh, he's just coming into the room. I can feel him. But hey, now let's give him a vehicle to flow. Let's give him an earthen vessel. So that's how I think. Because of that, the Holy Spirit moves in very particular ways. That is very incredible and unusual. But it's because I'm thinking, oh my God, he's here. It's not waste. It's not waste him. He's in the room. Like I was sitting with a friend recently. We did a conference together. And he's all about laughing, laughing, laughing, and throughout the conference. And it's all people are getting drunk and people are getting drunk. And I like the energy. And so at the private time, this is all between us here and my audience people to understand. He asked me in my private time, he said, I love him very much. And I love the laughing people very much. And he asked me the question. He asked me, so Kirby, what do you think of the joy? Don't you think that the joy thing, he himself said the joy thing hits me? I don't know what to do. It just comes. And I'm like, there's so much energy. And I'm like, yeah, I said it's a real waste of time. And he's like, what? I said, yeah, I find it the waste of time. If you don't know how to harness the joy, you have to have a container. And if it just comes and then it gets gone, like, no, then you can take that. And I said, when joy comes, I said, I don't have half the joy. Drunkenness that you have. But with the little I have, I do miracles. I see visions. I can do crazy stuff with it. Just with a little bit of that energy because I know the exact vessel to take that and send it through so that it can get out of my sight. And that's what a lot of people don't know. They don't know that we are the earth and vessel that has been plugged in and we are different forms. Like, a wire is different to a transmitter to a transponder to a circuit board to a whatever. And so I know that in the spirit what it is, what worship is a earth and vessel that can take that experience. A ritual, a prayer when I'm having communion and I need a worship in a certain way. That's why you see I will always do the Lord's Prayer. You see the liturgy of his service. I'll do Lord's Prayer. And I will do the creed. They do the creed. At wow, you see that in communion service they are doing Lord's Prayer, creed. Lord's Prayer creed. What is the creed? Lord bless you and keep you. No, no, no, no. What is that? Yeah. I don't have a voice. But come on. Can so many things. Yeah. What is called? It's called a blessing, right? Yeah. Why am I doing that? Because when I'm doing that, I'm presenting the exact vessel I need because that has been done for 2000 years. And the spirit and the angels specifically know how to fit into that vessel. Like this water can fit into this. And they know specifically to fit into the vessel of the communion and I'm doing it. So I need those songs to get it done. So each one of our vessels and remember the flow of the energy has to flow on gravity. The way you make it flow is humility, humility, humility, humility. And there's more humility. The more dead I am, the more dead I am, the more dead the congregation, if I can get you to be dead. And I can preach a separate soul and spirit, you die, I die. And then the vessel is empty and the spirit feels. So I think like that. So like when people worship and watching how dead is a dead, is a dead. And if the more dead he is, it feels like this is full. Okay. It will only fill this much. Okay. So that's why I preach. If you notice, I preach till you're dead. So, so, so yeah. So I'm preaching. First I'm dead. And then I tell you some crazy stories and people think like, why is it telling us these stories? And I'll be more vulnerable and I become like, I don't get vulnerable like cross. Right? I don't get cross-wonderable. But I get vulnerable to show that I'm just nobody. Right? And I want to form that in your heart when I'm preaching that you think like, man, Kirby is just like, just like me. And if I can identify, how do you know there's no killer in the room? How do you know there's no pedophile in the room? Okay. Now I need the Holy Spirit touching. And so if I identify with that, I might not be any of those things. But if I identify with that, and if I can get him to like, he's just like me, the Holy Spirit fills him. You see? Because it's a matter of making sure that there's enough room for the Holy Spirit to fill. So if the guy is pompous and righteous up here, the Holy Spirit will fill on you this much. Remember, we're always trying to cause the energy to move. Okay? And so, the end of the service is like when your eyes are open, and a lot of you guys, a lot of people will happen, your eyes will start opening. And so when you start opening, when you understand, when you see Holy Spirit like this, you see the rituals as sanctified vessels that can carry the glory. Okay? It's a very, it's a shape. So marriage is a very specific, sanctified vessel that can carry the ritual of the marriage that will carry the glory. The baptism is a very sanctified vessel that carries the glory. So you're offering up these vessels and it catches a bit of the glory. That's what you're doing there. Okay? So ritual is that literally. So the ritual of the, what we're doing today is a very specific ritual that can catch the glory for the energy, for that, for what you're going to do. Okay? And I'm going to show it to you. Last time we did confirmation that our Sunday, we see my message. It's like very prophetic messages that are coming because I said something that is like amazingly pivotal. Right? And people are not understanding. I said that how God has sentenced in man's body, he has sentenced sin. Okay? He's sentenced sin. Like just imagine, the devil gets sentenced in the flesh. Okay? With sin. So when Jesus came, the devil also came to the ground. Before that, he could fly the people of the kingdom alike, like the, with a wind. The Spirit is like wind. But then he sentenced them into the body. Right? Did you see that there? Last Sunday? So this is important because unless we see things like this, we won't understand why we need to do the ritual of the funeral in a certain way. So when you are a priest, first thing, few aspects of the priest. Okay? So the priest is a sanctified vessel that is ordained. So when, if you look at the, the diedak, the diedak is one of the oldest books, the, the apostles diedak. So literally it's 200 AD or something like diedak, right? And it gives you the prayer. I think it's a diedak or hypotelius, one of the two. The prayer of ordaining a priest, when, which, very soon you guys are going to get ordained. Your, your ordination is so that you can commission the sacraments. So do you understand the ordination? That means we are, you're, you're being ordained the reason so that you can now administer the sacraments. Do you understand that you can now use these, these tools. It's like a training. It's like a paramilitary training, but given you this is the gun you're going to use, this is the knife you're going to use. So the training is that you can use the sacraments. So that is why if someone who is not ordained uses these sacraments, it can not be as powerful as when you do it. That's what I'm trying to explain to you. Okay? Can someone else marry? Can a celibate marry in the name of Jesus? I'm sure they can. Can someone else baptize in the name of Jesus? Yes, I'm sure they can. Can someone give communion in the name of Jesus? I'm sure they can. But when you're ordained to do that, it's very different. Now, do you understand? Do you, do you, do you get that? Do I believe that someone else can give communion to someone and say, come, let me give communion in the name of Jesus? Fine. Do I accept it? I'm sure. But is he a set apart vessel? Is he a set apart vessel? Like this has been a set apart vessel for my coffee. Okay? Like, and I mean, I'm sure this can go into a discount. Okay? I'm sure he can go in there, right? But, but it's was set apart for me. This was set apart. Dushant, Dushant has bought this very specifically, search for it, made sure that the designs are done. You know how much you are taken to get this done. And then set this for this type of water. Do you see the amount of intention, the energy that's going to make this, right? So a priest is that. So a priest is like, just imagine the energy we're putting in here, the passion, the prayers, the heart, the suffering. Some of you were at ADC recently, and called, I just, the ordained ones to stand up. They want to go to ordained, at ADC to stand. Yeah. Can't give them a big hand. This guy's here. This guy's got ordained. Now watch this. Watch this. Okay? Okay. You can take a seat. I want you to understand this. If you don't get this, they flew all the way. Look at the intention. All the way. I'm going to get ordained. Okay? Then I bring him to the ADC. ADC are pastors who take their job so seriously that they're ready to die. Okay? It's not like another church. It's not like a Western church. Sorry. I love the Western church, but you don't get persecuted. So you don't still know. I can pray for you all that you all will. But then you'll understand what it is. Because when we are here, we lay our life down straight off to die for Jesus. You don't have to die again. You die immediately now. You're in Sri Lanka. So they're already ready. They are in the village. They're going to ready to die for what they believe. And in the so the witnesses seal the deal. So it's not you're not being witnessed by just some random church. They've been read by most of the people by literally martyrs and people already be martyred. It's a very, very distinct ordination. So that's why I'm trying to explain to you the difference. Okay? And so they are looking at it and they are telling you like well done, you know, you and I are the same. Okay? And they're confirming a witness thing to you guys. So I want to show you the intention of the vessel. The vessel that I'm creating. But people don't get it. What am I doing? I'm creating a vessel. Right? I'm creating a vessel. So and then the three bishops who would come each gone through hell. Okay? Two lay hands on you. Okay? And so three bishops it seals it. Three bishops seal it. And now what am I doing? Look at the intention of the vessel. So is it just like now if someone tells you just just I'm just going to ask your question. And if you're a priest you're watching me because they're a priest and distinctly another guy out there and he may be pray a lot every day. He's he's he has a good relationship with God. Okay? He knows the gospel of grace. Right. Just as come to him through faith and not by works all that right. Fine. I'll give it all that. Okay? And now he gives communion and you give communion. Just asking if you know the difference. Like nobody right but doctor is the same but could be I'm not talking about works. And not once did I say works here? I said intention. Yeah. Intention is a very funny thing. Not works. Intention. The guy who gives communion to a guy who is out there who's just gone and got a revelation about Jesus Christ. He got into Joseph. Joseph Prince church whatever. All right. Right. Just as by faith. Wow. God loves me. Yes. Jesus loves me. And then you get Sam. Okay. And Sam has paid the price. Come here. God did done. Set his intention. Is it our works? I'm talking of the intention of the whistle winds. Okay. That's what I'm trying to say. Not about how much work Sam has done. It's just Sam has been extremely intentional about it. Okay. So when we are talking of rituals from weddings to to to to to the funerals. The intention. Not of you. It can't be a person intention. The prophecy is not for private interpretation. It's passed down from generations of intention of intention of intention of intention of intention as the whistle. Okay. The ritual of a wedding has been passed down for better of a worse for ritual of a poor in sickness or in health. Those words have been passed down for thousands of years. Okay. And then someone comes in in a grace revelation or they think they've got a false grace revelation. And so I won't change those words. It's not going to be for better of a worse. It's going to be for better and for better. Okay. If you want me for sickness in health, we don't believe in sickness. We are from the faith movement. It's going to be from healing to everlasting life. What vessel is has more depth. The one that he created out of no intention. We're just waking up in the morning and say, Jesus loved me. Someone just changed the words. Or the one that has been passed down for generations. What is going to have the depth to hold the glory. Okay. This is why I'm saying the way we we we once you see holy spirit like this. The spirit moves into a vessel. You realize that. That the vessel of the ritual is very, very important. Okay. The basically don't mess around with the structure of the vessel. You can change it a little bit. But you must understand the principle of it has to be the same. The principle of it. Okay. So I'm going to discuss a couple of the principles are why they are different. I mean, doing a funeral. Catholic protestant. All is going to suffer today. Right. Okay. Now. So the spirit like I said before. The spirit is always looking for a vessel. Okay. And so holy spirit lives in you. You have a spirit inside of you. And you have a soul. Okay. So the body has something called a soul. You have a soul. And that soul is everything that is you like your humor. Your intellect your emotions is your soul. It's not your spirit. Okay. Your spirit is connected with the holy spirit. But your soul is your is your is who you are. Okay. So let me ask you a question. Then you get the body. Right. So spirit soul body like when you die. Your spirit like you'll probably know like your spirit obviously goes to God. Right. You guys believe it. And an audience. Please. Okay. I'm hoping that's exactly where you know you'll go. Right. The spirit. So but where is your soul go. This is the which is important questions. Can someone raise your hand. Let's be fast. Come on. Where is the soul? There's a soul. There's a soul. Live or the soul die or the soul. Yeah. What is that? Yeah. You can raise your hand and talk. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Soul goes with you. Okay. Yeah. But the soul. What is the soul? I'm talking about is the solely mortal. Yeah. Is the solely model. Yes. Yeah. Is the solely model. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. So your soul is immortal but it's yeah. Is the spirit immortal. Yeah, so the spirit is the model? The soul and섯. Right. Right. Okay. So you understand there's a difference. Right. Right? The spirit is from God. Yes. Okay. But your emotion. Your pain, your suffering. Your pin here is it immortal. Is the pain. I'm asking the question from you because your soul is your pain. So is the jumping Okay, the soul is a jokestety laugh at the pain that you've gone through. Is it immortal? I'm asking the question. Yeah, when I ask it that better. Yeah, okay, has it some of you change your minds? Did someone who changed your minds? If you change your mind now, raise your hand if you change your mind. I don't know. Ah. Okay. Yeah, so the soul is immortal. Yeah, so that's what's important. The jokestety laugh at. The pain that you've gone through. That's immortal. Okay, so when the spirit goes, you need that to go with the spirit. Okay, right. So when you're talking about funerals, you had the first understanding. Yeah, what are you having rights over? Okay, and this is a very important aspect because otherwise you will not understand certain aspects of the funeral and what the ancients, and I'm talking about every tribe including the Jews, how many of you have ever read a book called The Tibetan Book of the Dead? Yeah, you read the Tibetan Book of the Dead. And you will read it in the Tibetan, it's a Buddhist book. How they realize that when a person passes, that they would actually, I have the Shaolin priest who is a friend of mine, and he would say that they had tremendous rituals of the dead. And then if a person is dying, then once a person dies, they'll sit with the person and they will walk after that. After that, they stay there for many days, after that, walking the person out of the suffering of the body. Because they say that the soul is entwined in the path of the body. And because of that, the soul, when they die, doesn't know what's happening, they get very confused. And they walk the soul out of, and so it's a very extensive book. Like they go on and they're ready, but they said, they're going to explain, like, are you seeing a yellow light now? If you're seeing a yellow light now, I want to assure you that's the part of your kidney that is now leaving. Are you seeing it? And they walk the soul out of letting go, because the soul is confused, because parts of it is leaving. It's very interesting, because this is the same concept that the Egyptians had, and believe me, it's the same concept that the Jews had. So once you understand this, and it is scientifically proved, now the trauma remains in the body. So that is why different parts of your body have different hurts, pain, traumas. And so because of that, there is no separation between, like the spirit and the body are completely entwined, and that is why the word has to separate. Soul and spirit, spirit and both. We don't understand what Jesus does, is that he brings separation, because they are inculcated, they are both intertwined. And so you can't separate it, that is what inculcation means. I mean, you come here living in this body, and now you have become completely one with it. And so when you are dying, this thing, the way it takes off, unless you have a priest who is a Christian, who is able to separate your spirit from your body. The spirit and soul, from your body, with a word. You will realize that it is torturous to be not dying, but to be dead. And this is important to understand that the Jews really believed this, and I am going to show this to you. It is going to surprise you, but the Jews believed that, and this is amazing thing with the Jews, the Jews believed that it takes about a year for actually suffering to stop after you die. So this is important, and I will show it to you. I am going to show it to you in many, many places. You will see it in acts, in Peter's tomb. You don't have look for. Go to the Catholic church and go to Rome and look at their sins. And you will realize that certain sins are what they call, what do they call them? But they are incorruptible. How many of you know, or you see the sins, they don't decompose. That's the sign that this person was a good person. That means the sin did not corrupt the body. That is why you are called a saint. Because they realize that if you had love and you had no sin in you, your body does not decompose. That's why many of you are supposed to be solid bodies. Yes. Blameless, yeah. That's right, that's a good scripture. So just understand, these are very deep things, and they are very deeply mystical things when you understand that. And so pure people in the Christian faith, and who really forgiven, they can leave their body for a thousand years, and it will not decompose. And it smells of roses. And so that's unfortunately not decrement, people say we don't know really where they were. You were good or bad. But in the same way, it won't decompose at all or good people, and everybody understood, the good people, that means they remain immortal, incorruptible, or if they take a long time to decompose, like they are rotting and all that for a long time, they were very, very wicked. That's what they think, and they are suffering because the spirit is leaving very slowly. But if the person, either he doesn't get incorruptible, or he decomposes immediately, very fast. That means the guy is a good person. And this was the Jewish mindset. And so they had double funerals in the Jewish mindset. The first funeral was, and that is why, isn't it strange how Mary Magdalene comes to meet Jesus? After if the tomb was closed, that Mary Magdalene now is coming to meet Jesus, and what she was doing, with Jesus. And they say how the women came to meet Jesus. Like what were they doing? And you will realize that to quicker this process, or not to make sure that this person that they loved, will don't suffer, is where they come to the body, and they keep robbing the mud. And so when the mud is given, when the Magdhari gives the mud, it's the reason they give the mud, it's the scent for the person who is dead because now they are suffering, and they are suffering because of the sin in them. And they are corrupting and they are decomposing. And because of that, it's supposed to be, according to the Jewish understanding, supposed to be held in their body, while they are suffering and suffering and suffering, and slowly but surely, slowly but surely, the pain for their sins while they are decomposing. And so after one year, so what they would do is after the second or the third day, they would go and they would mummify you, and they would put in like beautiful, wonderful scent, the woman would have broken the thing and they would rob it on you, and they would cry over you, and they would wash you with water. Once you are dead, they are doing that because they think that the best thing they can do for you to feel better because of your suffering. So that's the kindness, the family, and the friends would show a person who is dying after they did, the first day, the second day, the third day, in that day, they would rob you, and they would wash you every day, and they would make sure. Because you are suffering while this is very disillusioned. This is important to get because this is why you see it across the Bible, we do not allow the Holy One to see corruption. How many of you have seen that word in the Bible? Come on, you did not read that word there, and you don't understand what it is, right? It says, we will not allow the Holy One to see corruption, God, you have promised that the Holy One will not see corruption. You are not heard that? It's all over the Bible, they are talking about the corruption of the body, like Jesus can't see corruption of the body. Now watch this, and so once you understand this, you will realise, then you will understand your role as a priest, because if you don't understand what you are doing, it's the separation. Everyone else is stuck, and the separation takes a long time, depending on how sinful you are, takes a long time. Then the Christian priest has the power to separate, to do what? The word of God separates, soul and spirit. This is something that is very important in Acts 2. What are you doing when you are doing a funeral? People don't understand, they go to the funeral, they have no clue what they are doing. Most people are burying people, do you know what you are doing? Do you know the authority and power that you have? Do you know why you were ordained? I was created for this very thing. I have the power to give you the right to passage. I have the power to give you the right to passage. The Christian ordained priest has the power to give the right to passage. Before I read this, I just tell you a simple story of, if you look at the, there's a wonderful book called The Saints that Rates the Dead. You see people like, what's his name, the famous guy who was in Scotland or Ireland, what was his name? St. Patrick. Do you know the Patrick when Patrick raced the dead? Do you know why people don't can't raced the dead today like before? What is one issue that they don't understand is issue. The issue of raced in the dead is for salvation. Once you understand that, that means someone who is, someone who is saved doesn't need to be raced. Right? Their heart was that men were to be saved. So when they pray for the dead, not to die, is so that they can get to know the gospel. If you pray for the dead with any other heart, they're not going to get a mark. You pray for them saying, I want him to know the gospel. Or if you already know the gospel, then you can say, Lord, I want him, his life. Now, one of my friends' mums on the silverware was dying recently and she was literally dying. The whole idea of my prayer, she revived, believe me, I mean, she was completely, she revived and we've done this so many times before. My prayer was, first, I know she's a part of my church, so I said, I'm not saying in the name of Jesus, I'm saying by the power of the church and my ordination that he was studying me, I'm not allowing the spirit to live. Nothing to do with, oh, I love this so much, it's to do with my authority. I will not allow the spirit to leave the body. I seal the head because that's where I leave the body. You will remain in this body until I release you. So that's when the spirit is waiting to get escaped. But I will not allow you to leave. You see, the right of passage comes from you. The right of passage comes from you. Now, watch this. When people pass before, when St. Patrick would go around, St. Patrick would raise people up from the dead, 13, 14 years in the grave. Just think about it, right? We are trying to raise people from the dead, four hours after they die. St. Patrick would pass a war zone and he'd look at the graves and say, when did these, when did these people die? Or about two days ago, there was a group of raiders that came and they killed all these people here and they go, wow, and he asked the question, but they Christians. No, they were not Christians, they were heathens. No, no, no, stop burying them. These are fresh ones. He would sit them all, put them on the grave and he'd pray over all of them. They all raised when they were dead because one thing is the heathens, I can't allow me to pass heathens and they can end up in hell. I want to be able to, or wherever in Sri Lanka, they don't believe in hell, they believe in what they call reincarnation. The spirit can go and just catch all of something else and be incarnated somewhere else because the spirit is free. They can go and catch all of a baby that looks like them in the same name and then go in. No, no, no, we don't, we want the spirit, I want the spirit to go to Jesus. So he'd raise them from the dead and then give them communion and then they'll die again and then he's like, oh, that's done now. You can go. You see, that's how he raised them. When he went into a village, he literally, the people, the two kids of the king were dead for 13 years. And then he realized this king didn't know what he was in the morning, the king was in the morning. He says, you know what, king, if I will, if I take me to the grave, they're drowned. I'll raise your kids, you don't know, but will you then give you a whole nation on a whole town to Jesus? And the king says, man, if you can raise them up, 13 years in the grave. He goes to the grave, raises them up, the whole town gives them self to Jesus. That was the reason for raising the dead because their spirits could be hovering around the grave. They can be in different, different places, right? So why am I saying this guys? Because you all have to understand what you are doing with the spirit. You have the right of passage to send the spirit to heaven. And that commendation, that's the most important part of the funeral. The funeral service, there's a committal and a commendation. I focus a lot on the commendation, less on the committal because most of our people, what do they call it, when they burnt up, they're cremated, right? They're not buried. Those people are buried, but now most Christians are cremated, right? And so when they're cremated, there's no committal to the grave, but there's a commendation of their spirit. Into your hands, Lord, they're coming to their spirit, yeah? But in the USA, you might have, even in the USA, and place a lot more cremations happening now, right? The cremation is a different thing, we'll talk about it. But the commendation part of the ritual is the most important part. And if you don't commend, if you don't commend correctly, what can happen is I have friends who have, I think I've told some of you guys, they have what is known as coma hospitals. How many of you know what a coma hospital is? You know what a coma hospital is? Yeah? Comas are people who have in comas, and they've been in coma for one month, one year, ten years, whatever it is. And so my friends are what they call mega-stimplish. They're part of like their big sorcerers. And so these guys, and I was trained, I mean, I first started, I was trained by some of these guys, you know, they would actually, they would never go to a Christian funeral. So, because for them is useless. So that's how I knew, like, they can't go to, they don't go to a Christian funeral. They find out if the person is a Christian or not, if they are Christian, they won't go to the funeral. Because they can't catch the spirit, so they need spirits of divination. Okay, so much of the Sri Lanka call is sars that are people and all that. They need spirits of divination. And so they need ancestral spirits. So they will go outside, and especially if you cremate as well, and you see the cremation, the smoke coming out, right? Because the body is now immediately being burned, it's such sending the trauma and all these things start coming out very fast. So, such coming out very fast in cremation. So they love cremations, right? And so they will go to the cremation and as they see the body burning and coming out like this, they would go there and they'll cast the spell and catch the spirit of the man. Yeah, the soul and the spirit boat. Yeah, together. They are trying. Yeah. The spirit will leave, but they'll pass out the soul. It's one body, but the spirit goes to the heavens, right? But the soul is slowly, slowly coming. It's that pain, the trauma, the different areas. So how much is the soul entwined on the earth? So you'll see the ghost up in the sky. Yeah, exactly right. How much is exactly right? How much? The person needs to show it to me like this, the best possible way. This is the earth. Say, this is a bad thing, I can't show it to my fingers. Fiona, Fiona will say something. How did it? Okay. Okay. Yeah, okay. All right. Okay, let me take a district. All right. So this district, okay. So the person needs to say it like this. He says, like this is the, this is the the the the the the the the soul, this is the spirit, and this is the body. And he says the body can only the five senses can only face the world, right? And the and the spirit can only face heaven and the spirit. So he says when, when you are before you're born again, okay, this guy, the spirit is very small, baby, okay. But these guys are best friends. So they're together. Okay. And then they're together. So the soul is now tied to the body. So like sex and drugs and what is that rock and roll and what is that good friends and all this and he's just like they're together. Okay. They entwined together. Most people who are not born again, okay, I like this. Okay. And then when they become born again, this guy slowly grows up like this and then pulls this out, I out of this. I grew up in part from the body. And that happens every day on the service when this word comes and separates you and separates you and separates you. So that is why it is so important that you're separated separated separated from the time you can't be church. So I'm going to show you a few things that is so important. And so if the soul is entwined with the spirit, then immediately decomposes and it's gone. Right. Yeah. If the soul is entwined with the body, it takes years. Right. Yeah. The spirit of an already raised one soul. Yeah. They're connected. They're all connected. It's just separate. It's only the it's us who can separate it. Where the soul. So what happens is the word of God. Okay. So it's all a process. If you don't understand the process of church, that means the first thing that a person does is his will. When he submits his will, when he comes to church and he gives his will away. Okay. That's the first dying of the dead. That's in the baptism. Okay. There is a separation and it's separating. Every time you come to church, you hear the word you're separating separating separating from the trauma of the body. Okay. And so just imagine the person who comes and says, yes to Jesus and gives him life to a past to a pastor. Okay. The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want. He takes me to green pastures. It leads me to still waters. This is a travel story that what people don't get is just traveling off the soul. When you're alive, so that it represents you in death. So when you say you have a pastor, he's the one who baptizes you. He puts a white linen on you when you're baptized in the old church, the right one, you know, in the pastoral candle, which is the candle for you. And they baptize you. Okay. So when they baptize you, it's the same guy, watch this. Okay. Who you gave your will to is the one who buries you. This is a very important part of it. He's the shepherd of your soul. He's the shepherd of your soul. So what happens is at your funeral, in that place, when you lose your body, if anyone taken in drugs, they'll realize if you take in any eye wasca, or if you take acid or something like that, you'll realize this. That whatever you think your spirit goes. Like you have no body. So you have little experiences where you'll realize it's so dangerous because if I think like pink mushrooms, I become pink mushroom. If I think like, or let me think of my uncle, suddenly I'm in front of my uncle. It's like that's in that realm because there is nothing gross holding you anymore. You're gone. Right. And so when it's not, when the spirit is not trained under a will not given the will. That's what happens. Okay. Like your spirit is out there. He's not ever been trained. He never been submitted. He's never followed a shepherd. So for the time you come to church, you give a new wheel, you're trained to build, you're trained to build. You hear the shepherd's voice. My sheep know my voice. My sheep know my voice. The reason he says my sheep know my voice is because of death because he's going to be the shepherd of your soul when you leave. And so when you give yourself to him, when you start and then when you're going, you know the shepherd's voice. You won't suddenly someone will say come and take you and put you in a bottle. You understand that. And because these guys will watch you passing out of the this thing and these guys are so powerful. They are trained. They are trained. They are ordained trained warlocks. Like they will go or they'll catch you. I have a friend. He has a whole lot of these bottles and he got the pictures of the person and the names because he gets to take gets him from the arbitrary random people. He goes and he's got the bottle and he's got the picture of the person passed on his day pass on his day. They all trapped and he does that you can't they can trap them for like four years, seven years, eight years and they become like they trapped in the bottle and they have to divine for them. So if a politician, he'll tell you okay, what is going to happen in Europe in terms of politics because that's that's the knowledge. What's happening in the markets. So they're so powerful they can grab your spirit and and they they're so serious about it. They have they have they have coma hospitals they buy these guys are very rich right they're talking of golden dawn stuff that they buy coma hospitals and when they buy the coma hospital they buy the coma hospital because they know that the guy is empty. Okay, that guy is empty the guy because and these guys like when I say my friends I when I say tell you I know these guys well when you meet them they literally did we asked them how old they are they'll say 2017 years 3000 years that's how they give their ages and they're like what do you mean he's like you see the bite of the bite of coma hospital body because when they are dying. It's not when they are dying and they get sick or they die they immediately enter the the the body and that guy wakes up but and so that guy wakes up and everyone think like but he's a bit different because he's got the same feelings and thoughts because of trauma that he's gone through but there's something else and they entered in. You see and then you go in very good at what he does a lot of stories like I got in a coma and I completely and I like yeah right like look how many times I got in accident and then suddenly I went to hospital I woke up from a coma and then I was very good at electricity and I can like. You you you're not you you're you but you're someone else as well right and so you see that this thing is very very real in terms of these guys how they do it so why they know this is because your your your soul your spirit and your soul can be. You know what I mean by that is that the soul can be captured and that is why the Christian right of giving yourself to a pastor being born again in a church and then the same the same born again nature is when you do the funeral and the pastor will say now you know my voice I'm committing you to the Lord Jesus Christ the father of all I'm sending you to my words I'm committing you you were you use and generally the last rights the what people don't get it is a process and it's not like I will never do a funeral for some I don't know. I don't understand if someone says here's a million dollars coming to a funeral like I'll I will never do it because I can't I know right you understand it if you say your your your friend or you have covering of him that's a different story like who was he covered under okay he's a hidden but who was covered under you you see the the the funeral doesn't start at the funeral the funeral starts off when the person calls you before he's dying or his mother or father brother says the calls you and says I think he's passing come last right that's the last rights. That is the most important part and in that last right you go in there because now he calling his pastor the shepherd of his soul he knows he's going to hand over he's going to he knows now you're the one you're the good shepherd you taken him down you let him to see what he knows your voice he's heard you he knows you he's trusting you your part you he's submitted his will under you you see that means that's why unsubmitted will unsubmitted will we don't know where they'll go they can get caught somewhere because he never submit to his will so he can he can be taken anywhere he wants like once he lost his body he's gross he can decide oh I'd love to go to uh Unavatu for my party or Santa Pay okay because I something bank he's in Santa Pay he's not been thought because there's nobody what you think is what happened in the it's a crazy thing that is why a trained will like guide me through this take me through my shepherd walk me through this okay it's a very important part of the process of letting go and so telling the person praying with the person going and saying hey you know what come on let's if there's anything that you not told me so far any unconfessed in anything that you need to tell me tell me right now because I can make sure I'm going to pray and I'm because in a couple of days I'm going to commit you I'm going to commit you to the king I'm coming to you with the father coming to you to heaven you see and your that process is so beautiful and he and that process is please forgive me for this yes I'm a part of the church you bringing back to the church if he's gone astray if he is if he's uh back slidden not going to church at the time you say I'm taking over the church is taking back I'm covering you again you're part of the body of Christ yeah you're you're you're owned by someone you're not a free will that is why people who commit suicide are never people who skip the but we can say that people commit suicide can't go to heaven now that doesn't mean that doesn't mean that guys that God blocks them from going to heaven it means that they had their own will the life murder God hates murder because the life the spirit is given by him okay so you cannot kill someone and take that spirit that's a that's a priestly thing to do that's a priestly a car thing to do if I take a person spirit by my own will it's like God gave him his life but I have a right to take it I can't I can't capture his spirit it's wrong to do that right so I can't kill but the same the concept of murder suicide is not in a Bible the concept of murder is there because I fight kill him and I can kill myself if I kill me I'm taking my own I'm killing I'm taking my own own own life like that means I'm nobody's I'm I'm mine I'm not God's I can give and I can take see that is why a person who commits suicide is in the Bible says they don't go to heaven it means that he was never the Lord he never was under a shepherds he was never submitted under his will so that spirit we don't know that I can go to heaven because anyone can take that spirit is it correct to say that we have more control in the body yes I'm watching on to your previous yes yeah right because we are in the body now we have autonomy and authority yes so that's why we need to decide now just to pin this on to your evangelism yes yes yes because once we lose the body yes we do we cease to have the down we don't have control of our spirit and our soul yeah we lose the body we train we train the spirit and the soul in the body that means through the spirit we submit our body don't eat this don't do this go to church every Sunday read the world all that is training the will for the journey you understand that it's training the will for the journey because if we don't this this how do we know we're truly God we we we don't in Advocate church or real Christianity is not teaching not preaching the cross it's teaching the way of the cross killing yourself daily submitting yourself daily your submitting so all you can only do it when you're in the body if you have no body nobody you can't submit your will like that it just goes wherever it's because there is no there's no gross movements okay this is your training ground to be able to be hits okay for the eternal eternal life okay so now in saying all this you mean when you understand how the realm of the spirit works is that the process the process there's a process of leaving and the Christian priest has the power to separate the spirit says no the spirit is mine but given to the church he gave his life from the beginning to end at the church this but this will is he's not taken his life this will is us the spirit is ours Lord we command this spirit until angels say in this come and take him right that is a very Christian thing to do no one can ever do it except for an ordained priest and for that that's why the ordination is important that is why you're being trained you're you're traversing with spirits you you have the power the right of passage so just imagine St. Patrick raises the dead where was the spirit before that hovering around there like a ghost right no one could send them anywhere it was just hovering there okay so St. Patrick is like now okay I raise your kids back but after that now they are committed to Jesus and they'll be able to be sent to heaven you see because the Christian priest has a right of passage what will the what will the other other philosophical priests do what will tell me what the Buddhist priest will do what will the Bible send them in the right of passage sansari yeah sansari yeah he'll go he'll go back descent right yeah yeah yeah okay say I'm an ordained Christian priest yeah but my family doesn't believe in Christ yeah but I would desperately want them their spirits to go to that working or in our working then what happens like how does that work in the next separate Christ so that so that so that that so right exactly yeah so we'll talk about all that okay you'll get all this at the end of this okay okay so that's good that's all that's all there's a great question right so the ordained first yeah yes yes yes yes yes the last thought yeah yeah the last thought yeah so that's exactly the last thought is exactly right there absolutely one point yeah the last thought when you die with the last thought is where you will go because they know that they know they know as the growth what it goes your last thought will take you wherever you want to go yeah so if they say I want to be born into a good life into a righteous life that's right where the spirit will go bang and specially unrefined spirits the unrefined spirits are not given the Christ they will go wherever wherever you intend them to go the cult cult masters grow something called the astral temple you see and the astral temple is really interesting it comes it's they got it from the tabernacle astral temples so these guys like if they don't go into a body they will they've already formed in the astral field they formed a temple like very solidly formed temple and they go straight into the temple and these temples like the pyramids and all these things what do you call the pyramids the pyramid is only a physical manifestation of the astral so actually those are just they are giving you just the infrastructure the skeleton of what is very developed in the astral so the Egyptian kings go into their astral temple and they are pre-send them to the astral realm and they leave in the astral temple right so like in that realm you go where where you want to go okay but you have to be very developed if you're if you're wicked if you're bitter if you're upset if you're trauma-entered if you're angry okay you can end up in a probably in a very bad place even in hell right depending on who you are that so we'll go there right now the Christian priest has the ability to take this spirit and send him into the arms of Jesus okay forget about astral temples forget all his nonsense right you can take this this poor soul who was just nobody he's not done a work on his soul he's not done any meditation he's not done any balance with chakras he's not said on a mountain for a long time he's not done anything is so he just poor old soul okay and he can say do you believe in Jesus and he gave his life to church has he got to church I gave myself a pass that I hear his voice Lord take me to still waters take me to shows that I be on this take me into your arms take me into heaven and if you said that I believe in Jesus Christ for you in my sins yeah like a thief on a cross today you'll be in any paradise the guy's never done not done one chakra balancing he's not meditated for one moment okay bang you know he believe in Jesus he's in heaven okay and it's only the Christian priest that has the power to do it yeah so yeah yes yeah no that's the interesting thing that's a very interesting thing how many people have no knowledge of him operato it has to be of a church a proper diocesan ordained church operato it's a ritual that gets it done okay the operantis makes it happen for greater but the operation is thousands we as a 2000 year old church you know it's this time that's why I'm trying to give you the liturgy of the church you have to do the exactly liturgy you do the liturgy like I'm telling you like you tell anyone who's ordained under an ordained banner bang yeah yeah yeah yeah so so yeah can you can you can you so now wait guys okay I don't want to put the card before the horse okay so now this corruption thing is very important so they believe in suffering why after after you die in the body, the decomposing. So that, it's very apparent, you see it here in Acts chapter two, they're talking of David and in Acts chapter two, Peter is given a sermon, remember, and when he's given a sermon about and so many people come to the Lord, it works like this in verse 24, okay? Verse 23, he says in him, him being delivered, he's talking of Jesus, right? Now he's given a full story about Jesus, he ain't been delivered by the determined purpose and the four knowledge of God, you have taken by lawless hands and crucified, he's talking about Jesus and you put him to death, right? I tell you the people, you have, you know, Peter's first sermon, this is the first sermon, you guys took him and you crucified him. Now watch, because now their main king was like David, was their like golden boy, and I watched, okay? He compares. So now you took this Jesus and you crucified this Jesus, right? Now he's telling the people, okay? Does Sandarians and all these guys, whom God raised up having loosed the pains of death because it was not possible, listen, that he should be held by it, by death. Okay, Jesus demonstrated this, okay? For David says concerning him, now he says, David wrote about this, okay? I foresaw the Lord always before my face, for he's at my right hand that I may not be shaken, therefore my heart rejoiced and my tongue was glad, tomorrow my flesh also will rest in hope, you see? My flesh will rest in hope, for you will not leave my soul in Hades, nor will you allow your holy one to see corruption. You see there, you are made known to me the ways of life, you'll make me full of joy in your presence. Then he goes to verse 29, men and brothers, let me speak freely. Now we must understand the culture. The culture is when a man dies, he suffers in the tomb, okay? A thief dies, they don't allow the body just to be scattered and eaten by burrows, okay? But a rich man, okay, this is important to get. A rich man could have their own tomb, okay? This is interesting. So the rich men, they had their own tombs, okay? And so you can take the body and they mummified and they wash it everyday and they massage it, man. They do it all, because it's suffering. And they put lovely owing months and all the, what is that, all the spices and stuff like that. And they want him to have a nice process of letting go of the flesh, okay? So that it's not rotting and corrupting. You just get the mummifying reason. The mummifying with spices and all is so that you don't rot out like a sinner and suffer, okay? You get it? So that's why they mummify the tomb and they keep the body to a rich man's tomb, will do all this so that you have a nice, you're suffering and after one year, what the Jews do after one year, it's the second burial, then they look at the cloth, the mummy, they look, it's all gone, the flesh is gone. And then they have the bones, the femur bones, the big bones, yeah, and then they take that and then they put it in a box. That is why Jacob says, take my bones. No. Okay, the reason is he takes my bones, it's the second burial, because after one year you'll have his bones. So when you have his bones, that concept of, of taking the bones of the people, is because they believed in the resurrection of the dead and they believe that if you have the bones, God can now put seeing you together in the expressive Bible and muscles will come on it and flesh will come on it and the bones will live, okay? So that's why they keep the dead people's bones, okay? But it takes one year in the tomb for the mummy to crumble like this, suffer, suffer, but everyday they put more spices to make sure he doesn't crumble like, doesn't decompose badly, so that the suffering is less and then they take the bones. Okay, this is an important aspect. Taking bones is, they call it forsyagium, or forsyagium, it's a way of keeping the bones that they kept in those days so that there'll be the raising of the dead. So keeping bones was important, okay? Now, men and brothers, let me speak freely to you of our patriarch David. Listen to, he says, now, now David spoke to Sam, saying you won't allow the whole you want to see corruption, okay, but he says, but now men and brothers, of our patriarch David, I want you to know that he's both, he's both dead and buried and his tomb is witness to this day, okay, that means he brought a, he saw corruption, okay? David says, you won't, so who is the, David talking about not of him because David suffered by your dead and he saw corruption. That is what he's saying here, okay? Therefore, being a prophet and knowing that God has sworn, sworn with and owed to him that of the fruit of his body, according to the flesh, he will raise up the Christ to sit on his throne. He was seeing this book concerning the resurrection of Christ that his soul was not left in Hades and nor did his flesh see corruption, okay? This not seeing corruption is a big deal. So guys, now watch what happened. So the Mary-Manning goes, looks for the body of Christ. The body's gone. For them, that's the worst thing that died. For the Jews in their culture, that is worse than dying because they don't get to put their incense and pour the oil and massage his body because he's suffering and where is his body, like, give me his body back because this is the argument about the body, constantly they're asking for the body because the body now is suffering, okay? So I need to be able to wrap him up in all this and I wear who has taken my master's body? Is a big problem for them. So you must understand when this aspect of the suffering with the, when you're leading the body, when Jesus was literally taken away and they realized that he was raised from the dead, this prophecy of David came true. That's the key here. Oh my God, he didn't allow the Holy One to suffer that one year like that. That's the prophecy, okay? So when they're saying, my God, it's true. What David said, he didn't allow the Holy One to see corruption, he didn't have to suffer for the one year and through the whole and go through all that pain of suffering, he didn't allow Jesus because Jesus was holy. So if Jesus was really raised from the dead, Jesus came and touched me, look at my body, it touched me, it touched me, it touched me. What it means for them, it was very different to us. For them, it was like, oh my God, he has to be the son of God because his body didn't corrupt. Did you just get it? For them, it was much bigger than what we have seen. They're like, oh my God, everyone has suffered that one year, true it, but he didn't allow Jesus because Jesus was so holy and righteous and you got it. So that was the big deal about the Holy One not sin corruption. And now that they're in him, so that's a question from John Bester. Yeah. So he says, okay, to be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord, second Corinthians 5A. Yes, yes. So he said to just expand on that. Yes. You just said, yes. Means now that that is established. Now if we identify in Christ, and we lose our bodies, that's what it means we are with the Lord. Yes. And there's no delay. No, if you have a Christian dying now, we don't go through that. I want to be very clear. Yes. That's why we have, that is why, because that thing is real, even the Buddhist believe it. Even the Buddhist today believe that it takes a long time for the pain, for the body to live. Right? And that is why the Christian burial right, immediately separates and we commit the spirit and so on. We have a transition immediately. But actually that doesn't happen in the burial right. Here's what I want to try to explain to you. It happens when you give your life to Jesus. And you start hearing about it, and it separates soul and spirit. So every Sunday, now it's happening now. Yeah. See, you're taking a cross up daily. And so by the time you go, you're already gone. Yeah. You're already in heaven. So all it does is commit your soul and spirit to heaven. It's a lot. These are yours. You know these ones. We are the only ones who can do it. The others are trying to attain ego death. The others are trying to attain it. They're doing thousands of years of meditating. And all this to try and do the separation, but they can't. You just get what I'm trying to say. So it's amazing authority, when you understand why you give yourself to a church, why you start separating, separating, separating, separating, so that most of you are gone. And then the final, the remnant, they call it the remnant. The remnant, it's saying, okay, in Jesus name, right now, I commit, I commit your spirit in your soul for your mortal life in heaven. Bang. Can I add just a word? The body then is corrupted. And that is why the commit, the commit, of the commit, when they say, now watch the commit, which we do, how to do here. We say earth to earth. Yes, ashes. That's the last. Ashes, ashes. From dust you came, from dust you will go back. Okay, because now I separated the spirit and give it to you. Okay, now you're no longer that. Just to add, yeah. Those, so this is to establish the soul attaching itself, identifying and morphing with the spirit. Yes. You know, so that's why it says, whoever loves his life loses it. Yeah. Whoever hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life. Yes, yes, that's right. So that's a script that separates the soul and the touches go with it. Can you give her a mic? I have one. Yeah, you have one, okay, good. Yeah, for your body. Yeah, that's very good, if you know that's excellent. Yes. This will explain a lot of things that you all don't understand. You see, then everything falls together. That is, we don't understand. Yes. Yes. Yes. No, no, no. No, no. No, no. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. Yes. Yes. So Jesus was very, very typically the prototype and the model. Yes. And so you see, when he says we love your life, you lose it. If you hate your life, you'll give it. He's ready to die, right? The man who's ready to go on across for others is already dead. You see? And therefore, his spirit is completely separate. Eternal life. That's why when you become a pastor, you're being a pastor means you're ready to die for your people. You see? And when that happens, you have no ego. So like people say, we are completely eagolous. Like when people can attack us or do whatever it is, we are dead. You're dead, you're dead, right? So what happens if I die tomorrow? Something bad happens to me. Where does my spirit go? Most of it there, someone will have to come in. Hopefully, one of you will do the funeral. And then I will get there fast. You see? Because you must understand that we are on a free to die. And that's why immortality can be a portion because if you are living, we are living not for ourselves. We are living for others, right? It's ego dead thing. It's so important. People don't realize when they say, carry across daily, commit yourself to church. They don't realize what is happening in context to afterlife. Like I challenge people to say, like, how do you know the Bible says, check yourself to see if you're really saved. The reason we do this is like, yes, be as if you gave yourself to Jesus on one 10 years ago at some altar call. But look at your life. You do whatever you want with your will. Your will is yours. But your will is yours. And then they commit suicide. That proves your will was yours. You never called your pastor or say, I've given you my will. You tell me what to do. So I'm saying that your will should not be yours. Can someone commit suicide? Can we commit their souls and spirit? Yes, I believe so. I believe so. I think it's even after they've done it. With all my heart believes so. Because I believe that they've not really had an experience like that. But what I'm trying to explain is, this is why the church is careful about the will. And the will after death is still your will. The will doesn't change. Just because you lose your body doesn't mean suddenly you become holy and righteous and become a saint. Your will remains the same. And that's why there's a regret and what is it? Nashing of teeth and regret and all that is after the afterlife. So can I have some of the scriptures? I'm going to show you that the Hebrew is believed in this. Exactly what I'm saying. And if you go into your, what is it called? Where is it darling? The clergy. Okay, going to the clergy. Yeah, going to clergy, the clergy training and it's Hebrew and Bible thoughts. You open it there. Let's read it. Okay. Have you got it? Are you all there? I can't hear you guys. Are you guys there? Yeah. Have you got it there? Yeah. You're looking at it, right? First one, the first slide. Concept in Jewish thought decay as a form of punishment. Read that, you will remind. Every minute and hour, in the very little jar. Yeah. Probably we can eat in the grave and sometimes seem as a purification process. Keep going. Keep reading the whole thing. Sorry, I lost the whole thing. That atones for the person's sins. The fastest, the faster the body decomposes, the more spiritually cleansed the soul becomes. Allowing it to transition into the world to come. Yeah. However, for sinners, decay can be prolonged or painful, symbolizing continued suffering. Okay. Can someone else read the Talmud in the midrash? These are all Hebrew texts. Can someone else read the midrash? Yeah. Read. Anyone read it? Shall I read it? Yeah. Talmudic and midrashic sources. Yeah? Yeah. Talmud Shabbat states that the decay of the body after death is a form of a torment for sins. The worms are as painful to the dead as needles in the flesh of the living. You see, these are all ancient scripts. You see? You see? Beracot. The worms are as painful as needles. They're really believed that you suffer for a long time when you're dead. Okay. Midrash again, another one? There's another line there. Beracot 18B. Yeah. The questions that the dead are aware of their decay and suffer because of it. Yeah. Keep going. Midrash Tanchumar, Vali, Krak. Yeah. Whatever. Yeah. Discusses that a righteous person's body decays faster as a sign of their purity while a wicked person's body decays slowly as a punishment. Zoha, Kabbalistic text, describes the soul's anguish when seeing the body decay as part of the cleansing process for sins. Okay. Excellent. Can someone read the Biblical sources or if you don't? Do you want to be a continued one? Yeah. Yes. Anyone else? No. Just for flavor. Come on, show one. For flavor. For flavor. For flavor. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Biblical sources. Genesis 3. Now this is from your own Bible, okay? Okay. All right. Yeah. By the sweat of your brow, you will eat your bread until you return to the ground since from it you were taken for dust you are and to dust you will return. Job 24. Drought and heat consume the snow waters. So the grave, those which have sinned, the womb shall forget him. The womb shall feed sweetly on him. He shall be no more remembered and wickedness shall be broken as a tree. Keep going. Isaiah. And they shall go forth and look upon the carcasses of the men that have transgressed against me. For their worms shall not die. Neither shall their fire be quenched and they shall be a boring unto all flesh. Now you see, we think that that there is the organ of hell because we don't have culture. We don't have cultural context. So when you start the worms, they won't die. They're constantly burning. They're thinking, oh, that is in hell. No, no, no. That is when they are dead for that one year it takes for the worms to eat them. And that's their suffering. Yeah. You see. I saw you also suffer when you get good. Yeah. You know the burn. Yeah, that's what it says. And they shall go forth and look upon the carcasses of men and I'm transgressed against me. For their worms shall not die. Neither shall their fire be quenched. They shall be a boring unto their flesh. So it means that the worms eating them like that, they say it's worse than needles when you are alive. But you're dead. No. But you're dead but they're still suffering. You see. They had their culture at understanding. They takes one year for this process to happen. So Daniel 12, too. And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake. You see. You can sleep in the dust of the work. Shall awake. Do you just get that? Right. And some to have lost in life. Some to have a lasting life and some to shame and everlasting contempt. Many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake. You see. Can sleep in the dust of the work. Shall awake. Do you just get that? Right. And some to have lost in life. Some to have shame. Okay keep going. Like sheep. Like sheep. They are laid in the grave. Death shall feed on them. And the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning. And their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling. So you see that it's supported. Some verses are supported. They have to be interpreted. But because of certain lenses that we already have, we not understood that this was a culture. That they really believed that the earth, worms eating them was a punishment that they could feel. Okay. And this is the understanding that was there. And so once you have understood this, you will realize that the power of the Christian right of the funeral. Okay. And I don't want to go into any other books. But if you just look at the Tibetan book of the dead, look at the Egyptian book of the dead, read all that and they will tell the same story of that journey of how the soul has to separate from the body. And it is now scientifically proven that trauma remains in the nervous system and the body. So for me as a neuroscientist, when I look at it like, oh my god, that is really true. If someone dies and has trauma and he's been hurt and he's been bitter and all these things then the unsubmitted trauma, unsubmitted trauma, right? It's there. But if you're giving a life to Jesus and you take on your will and you're giving it to him and you are submitted to him, you'll see that it's easy to separate it. Yes. You give it to all the Lord. So it's submission. It's submission. Submission it changes. Did you just get that? Yeah. Okay. Okay. Now if you're watching me from the USA and you think some of your friends need to hear this stuff and become ordained and come to the church and understand that there are more mysteries in the church and out there on the mountain. Don't share all the teachings but you can share this teaching. Okay. You can just share it and say check this out. This is what wildlife teachers in terms of ordination and this serious stuff. Okay. And the reason you're doing that is so that you can invite someone in. Don't just share it. If you think someone wants to be ordained and loves this stuff, then share it. Yeah. Okay. These are closed teachings and they're only for training clergy. Yeah. I think last week because it was really good, we did an extract. A very short summary, a snippet of that teaching. So those you can share maybe for this one as well. We'll do snippets. We'll do snippets as well. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And so we'll share the snippets and make sure you share it. So people think the mystical is outside the church. You know, understanding once you start getting the church stuff, you get into the miss, it's real mystical stuff. But it's only this stuff is kept for priests. I can't give this stuff. I don't have Sunday morning service, right? But it's kept for the priesthood. Okay. Now, so let's look at some of the ways of giving a funeral service. Okay. Let's get into that. So I generally, like I said, the most important thing from everything I've said now is the commanding of the spirit and the soul to Christ. That is the most important thing. Like, taking that spirit, remember, you have the right. You can take the spirit and put it in a bottle. You can take the spirit and put it in wherever you want. Okay. Or you can send it to heaven. Okay. Your job with Christian priests and not a sorcerer is to send this spirit to heaven. Okay. To where it came first came from and who is the owner of this spirit and that's God, right? And that's our job as Christians to send it right into the hands of Jesus. Okay. So Jesus died so that you can do that. Now, the way I generally get about a funeral is everything else can be. It doesn't matter till you get to this commendation part and the committed part. That's when serious business comes into play. But the whole aspect of the liturgy I generally would have a couple of wonderful hymns with a worship team playing that would talk about heaven. Talk about eternal life. Talk about so hymns bring it beautifully or talk about the commitment you have to Jesus. Okay. That's the way you should have it. Generally, we will have scriptures. Generally, the scriptures are Psalm 23. The singing of Psalm 23 is beautiful because it's about the journey here in the shepherd's voice going into still waters, following the shepherd wherever. This is a beautiful Psalm to add this thing or to read at a funeral because it's especially when you are Christian. It shows you, it shows the person and it witnesses to everyone around that this person had a shepherd over his soul. Okay. That means he's going exactly where the shepherd is going to take him. He's not going out of where the shepherd is going. Even if you walk through the valley of the shadow that you are with me, you're not yourself, the guide be, and they comfort me. You see, the beautiful Psalm to say because he showed that this person is a submitted person, he's part of a foal, he's a shepherd of his life. So Psalm 23 is like wonderful to do. Singing it with a hymn is amazing. Then of course, at a funeral service, you will have testimonies. And the testimonies should always be about, it can be, we have fun testimonies of people, people explaining who they were, it's all good, but there has to be at least one testimony from the church. At least one testimony from the church. And the testimony from the church is not just saying, he was one guy and all that, the testimony from the church is that he was a believer. The testimony of two or three witnesses seals the matter. So bringing in the testimony of one or two people, they're not possible to do it, but one more to say, my friend was a praying man. I used to see the time that he's lifted his hands up at church and pray. I've got so much advice, the right advice for him. It's one or two testimonies now. What are we doing? Remember, the Spirit is like energy. They're trying to give him, they're trying to, it's all a handing over thing. It has to be testified about to take his spirit and handing him over to Jesus, right? So this process has to be, he's in, in our moment, he's in the casket. Struggling, right? Okay? When we are now separating and we're going to give him over. At night before, I know we like to have a drink and go there and play carom and all it's going to suffer. But actually the night before, they should be at that body. People are laying hands on him, trying to raise him from the dead. He's a great idea. Because that commits him. That means someone is taking authority over the Spirit. You see, and that ability when people are, Arosha came and I called him on the first. And like the coffee was closed and we had the parlour, we were about to go. He's like, can you open the coffee for me? I want to raise him for that. You know, so yes, sure. Come. I mean, we had the parlour. We were about to take him to the, this thing and see, this is all leave the room, Arosha. Because that's one of the best things that you can do. Not even if he raises from the dead, it's because he's spirit realizes that he's the Lord. Because only by the name of the Lord, we'll be right. You see? He's going to raise his hands. I'm going to raise you from the dead. I'm going to come on, whatever. That really, for him, it's so, so, but the person is so comforting because like I am, I am here. So I'm going to him. He has a choice there that he'll make and he'll say, I'm coming, I'm going and getting him to make the choice before will be wonderful. So if a person dies, always try to raise them. If you have an opportunity, okay? Not public spectacle, but even praying, come on man. You know, you got the Lord, you can quicken this body, you can come into this body. At that point, the spirit is, he tries to make a choice at that time because at that point, what is remaining is there and he's like, can I come back? Can I come back in? Do I go? And at that point, that encounter for the will, the will is very important. And he knows, no, no, I'm not coming back. I'll be with the Lord. He makes the decision there. So that's one of the best things you can do. But you don't have to do it at the funeral, okay? Do it, do it, do it, do it tonight before. All right? It's good. You're telling the soul. You are the Lord's. Okay? It's very important that he knows that. That there's confusion when these things happen, right? And so then the Christian priest come in there and conduct in the funeral and he hears the testimonies and all this and remember the spirit is still hovering. The Bible, the Jesus says three days that the spirit would hover like that very, very, very close. That's why he lays a race as a last verse after three days because anyone could do it in three days according to them, right? Okay? So then, so you know there, telling him, people telling who is and someone testifying of him. This man was a man of God. He was a good man. He was a man of God. And then the pastor comes and says, I know him well. And when, if you're a pastor and you're a clergy, guys, be, you don't ever break the sacred or confession, but it is very important when you're a pastor. Like, you to be able to stay here. It's important, because people don't realize the things that I do at a funeral. It's very important to be able to testify as a pastor. If you're giving the homily, it is important to show his transformation, right? Because the world might not have known his transformation. So it is important to be able to say that this man was a transform man. He lived an authentic Christian life. And then you're certifying the testimony of the people around. This man was a believer. This man has a home. Now, here's the interesting thing. The Protestant and Catholics, the Catholics now believe in Purgatory, okay? So you must understand the Catholics don't say things like Protestants say, okay? And they are trained not to take it for granted, and this person will be in heaven, okay? And so you see the Catholics have a very very somber, like, we don't know that I'm talking about him, like, oh God, have mercy, oh God, have mercy, like, this guy might, like, and so they pray for the dead. Because, and I think praying for the dead is a great, great, great thing. I believe in praying for the dead, okay? Because of the journey, right? But the fact of the matter is they don't know that the person is still saved. You see? And so you'll see that the difference between the Catholic and the Protestants service, the Protestants service, like, will tell people like, oh, you know, he's in a better place now. You know, the Protestant passes, will always say, he's looking down at us from heaven. All of the Catholics will never tell you that. They will, they will, like, oh, that's not your business, you can't do that. No, you can't. Like, we can only ask the Lord to take him because he's still, he's, he's still, we don't know where he's now perigotry, he might have to pay a little more and then go. Okay, we don't know. You see? So that is the difference between the Protestants and the Catholic one. I prefer the Protestants, I want to be no grace, right? So we know that, if we knew the Lord Jesus Christ and he was given himself to the church, I'm, I'm still you, there's no way, no way that he's not going there. And I can easily say, when, in my home, I will always say, he's in a better place, he's looking to us and he comforts the people as well because they are looking for closure, right? So that's the, that's the difference between. So in the message, always give a message of the cloud of witnesses. I will always teach from Hebrews 11, Hebrews 12, the cloud of witnesses, John 14, in my father's house, there are many mentions. There are so many places you can take from, but remember to preach from the, the places where they have always preached from. Remember what you're doing is they're forming the ritual, yeah, dead if it's, they're giving the ritual, the ritual, dead ritual. Psalm 23, the use the scriptures, one Corinthians 15. These are always at every Christian funeral, you'll have Psalm 23, one Corinthians 15, John 14. These are, wherever you go, you can have this. So what are you doing? You're giving it the perfect vessel, right? For all the angels and all the right beings to be there, to be able to take him, when it's ready, okay? And so the last part of this is once they give a testimony, it's all right. Make sure there's one or two scriptures read from these areas, okay? So that now, what is happening? What am I forming? The will. I'm forming the will. I'm forming the will of the people. I'm forming my will. A lot of times I'm forming my will, okay, my intention, my intention, my intention, my intention, what I'm going to do, right? Now how I'm going to do this, right? And so that, forming the intention is very important. Forming their intention is very important. And then the last bit, if you're going to, uh, cremate, or if you're going to bury or bury, whatever it is, it's called a commendation. And I want to read it to you, uh, form, form. Yes, yes, yes. Yeah, I can take questions there. Yeah. So the commendations look like this. Hold on. Now I don't use all these words, but I'm going to just show you, there's some parts here. I took, I got this, uh, form, uh, I think you've cited the sources, right? Yeah. Because it's important to cite the sources. So, this guy in this book, Christian Funerals, like, he's got, like, he's such a cool guy, I don't know what's, what, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, the Anglican, the Baptist Anglican. And it compares them, uh, it's really cool. That someone has resourced like, so try and get a book, uh, Christian Funerals is, it's like a black book. If you're, if you're interested in stuff, uh, he really compares it very well. got a lot from him. But I'm going to read just a few from there and on the liturgy. So this part where the commendation happens, so there's a, I like this because I'm used to Methodist Funerals because I'm my grandfather as a Methodist. Methodist Funerals are very simple. There's a little bit of liturgy. We say something and then people say something back. I think it's very cool. I think I'm going to use this from now onwards. Now that you all know the crease, how much will it the crease last? Last Tuesday's the only note of crease. Saying the creed, I think it's so important. Because in the creed, it says, who you are. And I think in every funeral, you should have the creed on one side. And the Christian priest must say the creed. So I think that's a really cool aspect. And then this part I really like. So let's read it. This is literally from the Methodist prayer book. And this is how it goes. Can someone read it? God of us, it's such of, this is the commendation. So we are about to commend the person to God. Remember what you're doing. You're taking the spirit and you're commanding him to God. So first before commanding him to God, he commands him, commands each other. He reconciles everyone around. God of us all, your love never ends. In all fails, you still are God. We pray to you for one another in our need. And for all, and for all, any where, who mourn with us this day. To those who doubt, give light. To those who are weak, strength. To all who have sinned, mercy. To all who sorrow, your peace. So it's now taking an account of people and the congregation around. So it is very important. So keep true in us, the love in which we hold one another. In all our ways, we trust you. And to you, with your church on earth and in heaven, we offer an honor, glory, now and forever more. So you're bringing the church into it. You're bringing the community into it. It's not a random person. This person is part of the church. Then I like this part. I really like this part. And I think I'm going to incorporate this. A commendation of the deceased and to one another to God. He says, oh God, this part is really nice. Oh God, all that you have given us is yours. So literally saying, all of you give us is yours. As first you gave, let's say his name was John Doe. As first you gave John Doe to us, now we give John Doe back to you. You see, that's really beautiful, right? Yeah. A John Doe. Yeah, that's a really nice thing to do, right? I thought that was really cool. Yeah. So I say it's for our brother. For our brother, let us pray to our Lord, Jesus Christ, who said, I am the resurrection and I am the life. So let me, are you all following me? Yeah. OK. Is it? They're reminding people for you. Yes, they're reminding people for you. Yeah, yeah. They're here. John 17, Lord, these people that you give to me, they're not mine, they're yours. Yeah. That's John 17 right there. So that's really nice, OK? And then he goes on, I thought this part was really cool and I thought I really incorporated it in our funeral as well. OK. Lord, you console Martha and Mary in their distress, draw near to us who mourns for John Doe. And dry the tears of those who weep. And then the congregation, they are, say, here is Lord. OK. You see, they're there, the two, right? You wept at the grave of Lazarus, your friend, comfort us in our sorrows, here is Lord. You raise, OK, when you say here is Lord, can we hear here is Lord? OK. Can you all say here is Lord together? Can you do that, right? You can get energy in this room. You raise the dead to life, give to our brother, eternal life, here is Lord. You promised paradise to the teeth who repented, bring our brother to the joys of heaven, here is Lord. Yeah. Our brother was washed in baptism and anointed with the Holy Spirit, give him fellowship with all the saints. Yes. He was nourished with your body and blood, ground him a place at your table in the heavenly kingdom. Yes. Comfort us in our sorrows as the dead of our brother, that let our faith be our consolation and our eternal life in hope, OK? So all right. So that's, I thought that was really cool. And then it goes on a little more, which I thought was not necessary. But this is something I do at our funeral all the time. And I thought this was really nice. I do this already. But this is really nice, OK? And this is how you say this. OK, this is how it ends. Now this is the commanding. And this we do not have the burial. Sometimes we do it at the, now they've taken the body and they are at the, what is it? They're at the cremation. And they remember that when they take it and they put it there. And this is something that I say. So I say, into your hands, the merciful Savior we commend your servant, John Doe, acknowledge we humbly beseech you a sheep of your own fold, a lamb of your own flock, a sinner of your own redeeming. I think that's a beautiful word, right? Receive John Doe into the arms of your mercy, into the blessed rest of everlasting peace, into your glorious company of the saints. And I like to put here the angels in the light, OK? I think you have to put angels there. The method is don't, but now we go to the Catholics and you see just this part, how they bring the angels in. I think that's where they say, I think the Protestants can improve, OK? I don't so much like the Catholic one, but these parts are nice. Make speed to aid, this is the commendation, right? Make speed to aid, name John Doe, he says of God, come forth to meet him, he angels of the Lord, you see? Receive his soul, present in him before the face to the most highest. May Christ receive thee, who has called thee, and may the angels again bear you to the bottom of Abraham. You see, that's really nice, right? Because you're handing out the angels to take. So I think, you see, look, we are free, we are Protestants. We are free, you can change this around whatever way you want, but I want certain aspects here to be there. The cloud of witnesses, and also the angels, OK? And then this part, this is how Daniel can say it, OK? Anglican, not bad, OK? There's a Methodist, we're talking of Catholics, Anglicans. Give rest to Christ, to your servant, with your saints, when sorrows and pains are no more, neither singing, but life everlasting. You only, you only are immortal, the creator, the creator and the maker of all people, and we are mortal, formed of the earth, and to earth shall we return. For so did you ordain, when you created us, saying, you are dust, and to dust you shall return. And all of us go down to dust. Yet even at the grave, we make our song, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah. Give rest to Christ, to your servant, with your saints, the sorrow and pain are no more, neither singing, but life everlasting. You're the sign, right? Yeah, yeah, sign with life everlasting. I prefer the, with the free Methodist, nice, yeah? Yeah, yeah. That was really cool. That's the one I'm really used to. The other, I think you can maybe incorporate if you want, OK? That's the commanding. That's the most important part. You see, and you see the aspects of handing over to the angels, handing over to the saints, handing over to heaven, commending his spirit over to father. That's your right as an ordain priest that you have to do. After that, there's something called a commital, dust to dust ashes to ashes, until the resurrection of the dead. That is a commital that you can do when you put the body to the ground, but that you can do in any way you want because you're committing the bones, and this is so important. This is giving the commending, is giving the spirit. A commital is committing the bones until the resurrection. So there are two different areas. Now, when you're in, when you're taken your ashes and you've committed yourself, the earlier, the Christians before didn't like this, but now it's good to be able to maybe have a place where that urn can be, or a place where those bones can be. Without, if you want to throw it into the sea or something like that, then people want to do that. Like, people, but try and tell them, if you can recommend, why don't you just keep it somewhere or something like that? You don't have to have it at home. People are very, very, very, very, very at home, but at a certain place, or whatever it is, it'll be good or buried. It might be a good idea to get that done. So that's few rules. I hope you guys have seen that it's not just like an easy thing or some random ritual. It's a very well thought of aspect. That is so important. As you get to the sacraments, you'll really realize. I told you, when you finish sacraments, you're like, people falling in love with church. And like, I understand why we do church and what the importance of churches and the importance of all these wonderful sacraments. Okay, I'll open up for questions. Yeah. Well, we're from the Michael. Yeah, so a question. Yeah. Say the person that I was talking about, I'm John, but he will say to Christian, Catholic and we as family are invited to the funeral. Yes. But there is a Catholic faith, right? The way they say it. What do you think should be our role if we have any coming in his spirit? Yeah. Yeah, you have you. Yes. Thank you. Thank you for the question. Yeah. You have no right there. The priest presiding has all rights. Yeah. And the best thing is, don't confuse it. Yeah. Because this spirit will be like, you want to, you, you stand with the Catholic priest and say, we're back in 100% that every year's be yours and every no we know. And yeah, unless you feel that the Catholic priest like saying this person can't go or something like that, they do that sometimes. That's when you can come in. Sometimes I'll go into a place. I do it a lot. The idea is in my house. People come to my house and they're like, it's so bright and nice and all that. And you see that I have a fire pit. People don't realize that it's mystical. I have a fire pit. People don't understand why I have a fire pit. It's a very hot place. But it's because you see I'll go into a place where I find my best spirits. And as a Christian priest, I have the right because there are thousands and thousands of spirits in the area. And then I'll light the fire pit. And I will then in the evenings I'll pray for the dead. And I'll send, I'll invite the spirits and say, I've come, your name of Jesus. And you have never met a Christian priest before. You were, you never knew the Lord. You may hovering around these places. I want you to know that I have the right to send you into heaven. And I will converse. And people will think that this is very strange. But I'll have direct encounters with them. And I will then send them through the fire in the heaven. So, but you have the right to do it. There are spirits that are on the earth. There is waiting for an audience priest to come. They can't go until there is a Christian audience priest. And they're waiting like when you come. Like that's why if you look at our house, like every house we go, like the garden gets very happy. The flowers get very happy. And like all the spirits like, oh my god, he's here. He's finally come. Finally, an audience Christian priest is here. And the spirits that are like they stuck on the trees and stuck into, they get stuck on to different areas. And they want to be released. And they wait for you to come. And when your eyes open, you'll see it. And then people, even now you will see that the dead will come to you. And people will wonder, like, why am I seeing the dead? Like, why am I seeing the dead? And you're seeing the dead because they want to be sent to heaven. And then there are the only way to come to a Christian priest. And so from now on, just because you've been trained, you close your eyes and you start seeing people you never knew before. And then you start seeing them in old clothes, you know whatever. And they are coming to you. And when you know when they come to you, say, I am a Christian priest. You don't have to traverse with them. You don't have to talk to them. You don't have to ask the rest of them. That's not your job. OK. You're supposed to say, I know you come looking for me. I'm a Christian priest, or them by God. And I can send you. I can send you. And you can send us all. So how many of you have experienced that? I've experienced that dead coming to you. Yeah. Raise your hand. Raise your hand. Look around you. Raise your hand right up. I want you to understand. That's why you're called to be priest. That's why you're called to be priest. OK. You have to give them the gospel. They have to receive Christ. Yeah. So when they come, they might not say, yes to you. In that realm, you can't talk like that, right? But if they come to you, you tell them, you're coming to me because I'm a Christian priest. I want you to know Jesus Christ is Lord and Savior. And if you want. If you want to receive Him, you'll all say, you know, I will then. And then you light a fire in your God. And then you say, that's why you light my fire. And that's why I have a fire for the dead to go through. No. Yeah. You can light a candle for sure. And especially if you come today, like never do it on a good Friday. But when you come today, it's like Easter and places like that. And closer to good Friday and so that, they are perfect timings for all these spirits that they want heaven. OK. Yeah. Don't go looking for it. Do not ever go looking for this stuff. You can get into big trouble. Please do not. You're not supposed to travel through the dead like that. They come to you. That's why I say, how many have experienced the dead coming to you now? Then you'll realize, like, they're coming looking for a priest. They know. Now when you get all-end, you have a lot of experiences like that. And it's not freaky. It's not spooky. It's not like this. Oh, like this. Like how these new age people think of dead? It's just like they come and go and become. You say, yeah, it's your job. Shall we take two questions? Yeah. Shaman. Shaman. Yeah, Shaman. Shaman, one, one, one. OK. Is it dangerous to do that? And is it dangerous to do that? And do you have to cover yourself what kind of an encounter is it? Don't do it until you're ordained. Once you're ordained, you're already covered. So it is never dangerous to do it as an ordained priest. It is dangerous. Extremely dangerous to do it. If you're not an ordained priest, if you're just a Christian in a church, even you should not do it. You're not ordained to do it. So the instrument, the yola instruments, what we're doing is we are taking yola, we're creating yola as specific instruments to institute the sacraments. So the burial is one of the lower sacraments. The burial and the spiritual these things. So you are ordained for it. So because of that, like I will never find it dangerous. But if I tell someone who just comes to church and they say, oh, they did come and I tried to send him. I do become priest and get ordained or just leave it. You have no right. Tell them to come to me or support it. I won't do it unless we are ordained. Once you're ordained, you're like a specialized weapon man. A specialized weapon for the spirit world. They're waiting for you. And for that point of time, you can tell a spirit to stay or you can tell a spirit to go. Like I did with the honest spirit, I said, you will stay. Seal it. I seal you. You will not go until I send you off. That's the difference. Then the spirit says. But you can only be ordained. Okay, there are some people whose families, loved ones, haven't received rice. Yeah, very good. And they are in this doubtful place. Will I see them in heaven? Will we be together eternally? Now, it's a temptation for them. It's a desire for them to want to connect. And then give them the gospel. And I know this can be controversial. But I thought maybe you had to address that. If you're a family and your father and not some random spirit, like your mother, your father, your brother, your sister, completely different story, I'm talking about these random spirits coming and the people trying to send them off. If it's coming to you. Not coming to you. Not coming to you. Not coming to you. Obviously, if they come to you, then it makes sense. If they're not coming to you. I did not come into you now. No, so the fact of the matter is, there's an interesting verse in the Bible. And this is not doctrine. There are certain doctrines that I have. These are not doctrines. These are the just ways I interpret. And so there's one part of the Bible where I think Paul and Celestial is in prison. And they were released. And the prisoner comes and Paul gives him the gospel. And it says, you and your household will be saved. Yeah, I'm going to be saved. You and your household. And it was after the day, we see, brought back by Paisen all that. So the fact matter of matter is, there is a very mystical teaching that God saves you. And this is old theology. This is not my theology. It's old theology. That means like Manju was a Buddhist. Now God has no access to his ancestors because of all Buddhists. Ruchi was a Buddhist. God has no access to ancestors. It never got to gospel. So there's something called retrocosality in the doctrine theology. It's very beautiful that he saves Ruchi and he saves Manju because then in retrospect, they become the priesthood that saves the whole line. Yes. And so that is called redemption of all things. God saves so that you turn back and because of you, because the Bible says because of your father, I have, I'm saying this to you. But it's also the other way around. Because of you, retrocosality, I can save a line down in the generations. Because of the sun. Because of the sun. So that's what happened with Jesus, right? Because of the sun. So I do believe that Jesus went down to the when he passed straight down and he preached to people who have not still gone to heaven, right? So that means people can go and stay in a place and they're waiting and then Jesus went and preached. He's the same yesterday. He's the same today. He's the same forever. And if you did it then, I believe that your parents and all the people who didn't know, they're in a place that God, Jesus can go once you get to know Lord, and go and preach them there and they can choose them and take them up and lead captivity captive and it took them into heaven. So I truly believe that that is possible. That's why I said, the Catholic doctrine of praying for the dead is not a bad doctrine. That is, in, purgatory is a bad doctrine. That they're suffering in hell. I showed you the suffering that is happening in the body, right? But it's suffering in hell and that I'm not so big on, right? But I do believe that you can pray that those who have passed can go. Can I just add to this? I think this is all really nice and it's meaningful. It's important. But it must not become, and I'm saying this because there's a tendency when you lost a loved one or when you're really missing someone or traumatized, you can really pull you down and it can cause you to emphasize and be obsessive about something because you're talking of somebody's son. Somebody's grandson, somebody's. So there's an opening there for spirits to come and feed off those emotions. So we mustn't, we must be very careful to balance this out. This doctrine can be really controversial. It can be taken in a negative way. Don't want anyone to take it in that light. It has to be taken in the spirit of Christ, in the eternal purpose of Christ. We're now busy with the living, right? And if encounters such as this come so good and well, if not, say a prayer for them and then leave it. Yeah, now we pray every day, we pray, before we go to the, we pray for those who are suffering in hospital, like if we feel like, okay, everyone in the world is suffering hospital. Everyone today who's passing, like today, there are a lot of people who are passing right now and they're, they're souls in the spirits, are leaving their bodies right now, Lord. I pray for all across the globe. You have the right to do it, you see? And then what happens is those spirits can find homes. They can find a priest, they can find something, something can happen. So pray every day for the poor, pray every day for the dying, pray every day for the suffering, pray every day. As priests, if you want to see an increase of power, don't just pray for your people, like especially, especially if one of your people that you love very much is sick, you must not pray only for him. It's a very selfish thing to do. Like if my father is sick and I'm starting to pray and the Lord says, stop, pray for everyone who's suffering. So a lot of pray for every other world who's suffering like my dad. It takes us out, you see? You have to pray for everyone. Obsession on our selfishness. The person, the believer can pray for one person. The priest cannot, you have no right. You cannot just pray for one person. You have to pray for everybody in the world. This causes your faith in God to increase. And you see powerful prayers happen. Yeah. The speech of the Holy Spirit is all up in half. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. So you can say when you said dead coming to you, first you feel a random spirit in your house. Yeah. We don't know what those spirits are, darling. They can be a spirit of man. They can be a demon. They can be random spirits. Can be just random, exactly like we say. They're millions of spirits. We don't know where they have spirits of men. Right? Unless, so let's see, don't get involved in this stuff. Yeah. Till you are ordained. And I will teach you exactly how to get all this done. But I'm only showing you a bit about my life that people think are a bit weird. Okay? There's a lot. This is just so exhaustive. Okay? I'm just showing you a little peek into this stuff. Some of you will start having encounters. When you have encounters, please tell me. And it's very important you do not engage till you are ordained with any of this stuff. We have a start at the War of Ghost Busters team here. Yeah. You're a pastor's in training. Stay in that place. Don't do anything beyond that. Yeah. Except for Manju and all of these are ordained pastors. Sorry. Right here. Yeah. There's more and more like that. Certain spirits are still hovering around, right? Yeah. Like there's a scripture with Lancers and the rich beings. Abraham. Abraham. Where it says that Lancers was taken to be by side of Abraham and the rich man went to Hades, basically. And he says, can you send Lancers to my brothers? Yeah. So Abraham says there's a divide that one can't go from. So how does it reconcile in terms of who goes, who hovers around kind of produced? So he says there's a divide. You can see how the Jewish thought worked. And that's really interesting because at that point, they divided Jesus' died. And then you say the same people, this very interesting. From the grave, that's the corruption. When they said people who were in the grave, when Jesus died, suddenly came out of the grave, that's the corruption issue. That the bodies were, I mean those bodies did not see corruption. Do you understand what is happening there? It's a massive issue, right? So after Jesus died, I believe that that divide shifted because you see that even in Jesus' life, Elijah and Moses came. Yeah, I know. So Jesus made heaven and earth one. So that divide, that was an old Testament concept. I don't believe is any longer because Jesus spoke to the dead. So when someone says you can't talk to the dead, I like, look. Then Jesus wanted these. But I've said, shush, too. When Elijah turned up and Moses turned up, he was like, hey, you know, this is like, you know, like, oh my god, the demonic leave. He didn't do that. He spoke. So I'm saying that divide, that is no longer there any longer. But still, we are in training, right? So, yeah. Yeah. Is there any point that Christians have a performer Christian funeral? Of a someone? Is there any area where we can't have? Yeah. One takes their life. Yeah. No. Yeah. If, please, if someone takes their life, please, I'd like to take a funeral like that. The reason is, the Lord has given me insight on that, a lot of insight on that, and how to work with that spirit. And so I need to meet that spirit. And that spirit is, on the Catholic Church won't, but we can. And those are the why I do the fire thing. Those spirits, you can absolutely bring them into the Lord. Yes, absolutely. 100%. So I don't believe it. But I'm only giving the apology, why the church says that they won't allow someone who is committed suicide, go to heaven, because their sin, the wheel has not been trained, the wheel has been their own. But we, in the Protestant Reformation, we believe that many people from Buddhist to Hindus, to people who are whatever, if a Christian priest means in the realm of the spirit, there is a level that we can operate, where we can send their spirits. Yes. I believe so. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's one. So that your right hand, you will decay faster, and the soul will separate faster. And then you have, you said like, there are saints who they relic and who don't degrade at all. And then you have like in the Bible, you have Elijah and then Jesus, who like the whole flesh went to the Spirit. Is that absolute immortality? That's why Enoch, Elijah, people like that, the body. Most of us as body was a problem because they couldn't find it. Because this problem of the body is this body, the decaying issue. That means you will know exactly what type of person the person is on the decaying issue. Right? So that's why Elijah and Enoch, they walk and they took him in the body. They did not face decay. It's a big deal for them, the decaying thing. Jesus did not see decay. It's a big deal for them. Okay. Also since we're talking, you know, the final thing, just the statement. We are, we, well, it's pre-mixed. More commonly we pre-mixed. We're becoming a lot now. Yeah. And so there were questions about, you know, should we preserve or not reserve, but bury the body in the coming and if you burn the body, what happens of it? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I think just to finish off, I believe the same God who can bring bones together, can bring ashes together or elements together. I mean, I think, don't think he has a scientific problem. So I am okay with, yeah. So people that know that bones and ashes. Yeah, yeah. I'm completely okay with creating or burning or whatever way they make little pendants now, and they walk around with little pendants with diamonds that they made it into. Whatever. Yeah. Okay. The first most important thing I'm going to do with this is that our Lord Jesus Christ conquered death. Yeah. Okay. He had a way to conquer death and for our soul to be immortal and to live forever, and also for him to come back and have a glorious body. He's called a resurrection or dead. He went beyond everything I've spoken on now, and that is why we call him God. Okay. Thank you. It's not the end. It's a transition. Yeah. Can we pray? Yes, please. But we praise you and we honor you. And as we talk about these amazing aspects of your victory on the cross a lot. What a journey you came for. You came for us. You saw us. I just leave your hands up, guys, and just say, Jesus, we love you. And we ask you Lord, you're not the God of the dead. You're the God of the living. And Lord, we ask Lord that you will quicker our mortal body is Lord, because you have gone. And because your spirit now develops in us, that you will give us that same resurrection power. And our family is Lord. They will live long on the earth, a God. And for the dead, you will sanctify our souls. And you sanctify our bodies. And you will call us saints because our bodies will not see corruption. In fact, David, we have that eternal life living in us. And the resurrection spirit, quickening our bodies. So that we will be epitomized. Like you have promised to God. Saints who not even just are incorruptible in the tomb, but are incorruptible in life itself for God. That is your promise. We're not asking it out of an entitlement. We are asking it only because you're pure, incorruptible son. Immortal son, Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.",
